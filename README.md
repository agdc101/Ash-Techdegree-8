# employee-directory
This project was built from scratch using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. This page uses the fetch api to interact with a server, which in-turn fills the page 
with 12 random employees. The page also features a modal view which displays more information about the employee and allows the 
user to forwards and backwards through the different employees. There is also a search bar which allows the user to search for a particular employee.
